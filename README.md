Raspberry Pi basedd gaming handhelds!

Greetings!

Name's M1ggles, I just popped my cherry on electronics assembly and looking to get into the programming side of Raspi based gaming handhelds. My currenty project is based around SpotPear's 1.54 LCD display for pocket gaming,ad I'll see where I go from there.

Cheers!
